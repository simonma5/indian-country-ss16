	  <hr>
	  	 <p>Environmental changes are threatening many facets of life for populations across the globe.  American Indians are particularly affected by changes of environment.  In the past, American Indian groups have been romanticized into exemplary stewards of sustainability.  Today, with climate change threatening the way of life of numerous American Indian communities, some groups have become environmental stewards out of necessity.  One example is the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians that was recently recognized as a national leader in sustainability.</p>

         <h3><center>Sustainability and the Environment</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

DOI:10.1108/14676370210434679 accessed April 21, 2016.">Wright (2002:218)</a> highlights physical operations, research, environmental literacy, ethical responsibility, institutional cooperation, and industry partnerships.  These themes are not all inclusive, and sustainability in itself is enveloped in ambiguity.  Applications of sustainability vary widely, and these systems are accompanied with a range of possible effects on the environment, most of which still fall underneath the umbrella statement of sustainable.  This can be problematic when discussing issues of sustainability and labeling specific actions, behaviors, or practices as sustainable.</p>
		 <br>
		 <h3><center>Past Portrayals of American Indians and the Environment</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Historically, American Indians have been used as symbolic images for sustainability through many aspects of Euro-American pop-culture.  Anthropologist <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Rosaldo, Renato.
1989. Culture and Truth: The Remaking of Social Analysis. Boston: Beacon Press.">Renato Rosaldo (1989:69-70)</a> uses the term “imperialist nostalgia” to explain the relationship that colonizers have placed on American Indians and the environment.  This relationship is evident when looking at environmental education.  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Stapp, William, B.
1969. The Concept of Environmental Education. The Journal of Environmental Education 1:30-31. DOI: 10.1080/00139254.1969.10801479 accessed April 21, 2016.">William Stapp (1969:30)</a> defines environmental education as “aimed at producing a citizenry that is knowledgeable concerning the biophysical environment and its associated problems, aware of how to solve these problems, and motivated to work towards their solution.”</p>
		 <p>One example of how American Indians are generalized and appropriated for Euro-American environmental education is the emergence of the Boy Scouts in the 1900s <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Willow, Anna J.
2010. Images of American Indians in Environmental Sustainability in Higher Education: Anthropological Reflections on the Politics and History of Cultural Representation.

In an effort to return boys to a more “manly” state, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) borrowed themes from many different American Indian communities as activities and teachings for young boys in the BSA program <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Willow, Anna J. 2010.

The appropriation of American Indian customs, practices, and ceremonies is evident in the photo of BSA members performing a ceremony at Camp Tichora in the 1950s.</p>

		 </figure>
		 <p>This idealism of American Indian cultures and their relations as environmental stewards continued into other forms of environmental education.  In the curriculum for Project Learning Tree (PLT), developed in 1976 for elementary education by the American Forest Foundation, three activities focused on American Indians <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Willow, Anna J. 2010. Images of American Indians in Environmental Sustainability in Higher Education: Anthropological Reflections on the Politics and History of Cultural Representation. American Indian Culture and Research Journal 34(1): 67-88. DOI:10.17953/aicr.34.1.413458lr22424615 accessed April 21, 2016.">(Willow 2010:76)</a>.  These activities are problematic as they imagine American Indians as stewards of the Earth in a historical and often inaccurate setting.  One activity includes a passage of text titled “Message from Chief Luther Standing Bear,” but it does not include any information stating where or when the quote was recorded <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Willow, Anna J. 2010. Images of American Indians in Environmental Sustainability in Higher Education: Anthropological Reflections on the Politics and History of Cultural Representation. American Indian Culture and Research Journal 34(1): 67-88. DOI:10.17953/aicr.34.1.413458lr22424615 accessed April 21, 2016.">(Willow 2010:78)</a>.  This removal of historic accuracy further perpetuates the idealist imaginings of the existence of an “Ecological Indian.”  Another problematic aspect of these PLT activities is in the context these American Indian communities are placed, or rather are not.  In the teacher’s guide there are limited details about contemporary American Indian communities <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Willow, Anna J. 2010. Images of American Indians in Environmental Sustainability in Higher Education: Anthropological Reflections on the Politics and History of Cultural Representation. American Indian Culture and Research Journal 34(1): 67-88. DOI:10.17953/aicr.34.1.413458lr22424615 accessed April 21, 2016.">(Willow 2010:78)</a>.  If this information was not relayed to students, the stereotype and misperception of how contemporary American Indian communities exist is left out of the educational sphere <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Willow, Anna J. 2010. Images of American Indians in Environmental Sustainability in Higher Education: Anthropological Reflections on the Politics and History of Cultural Representation. American Indian Culture and Research Journal 34(1): 67-88. DOI:10.17953/aicr.34.1.413458lr22424615 accessed April 21, 2016.">(Willow 2010)</a>.  In this case, the use of American Indians in educational context is purely at the benefit of the non-native communities.</p> 
		 <p>This is not to say that American Indians do not have an ecological stewardship relation to the environment.  In fact, global research of indigenous people exposes a knowledge of the natural world in an ecological as well as cultural sense <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Krech, Shepard III. 2005.

The portrayal of American Indians and their relationship to the environment are not entirely off-base, but they do need to be kept in context, and avoid stereotyping or generalizing all cultures into one pan-Indian idea of an “Ecological Indian.”</p>

One example is the reliance on wild rice or native fish populations as a food source and economic resource.

		 <h3><center>The Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians</h3>
		 <h4><center>Acting as Environmental Stewards</h4>
		 <hr>
		 <br>
		 <p>Many American Indian communities are finding themselves in the role of facilitating their own counteractions against the loss of native species, reduction of air and water quality, or the need to regulate wildlife populations.  Individual communities are tackling the issues of climate change in their own ways.  A good example of a group that has been working proactively against climate change is the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, or Sault Tribe.  Located in Michigan’s Eastern Upper Peninsula, the Sault Tribe has a 7 county service area.  The Sault Tribe has 44,000 members, and covers a large land-base within the state of Michigan <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Sault Tribe. 2016. Story of Our People. http://www.saulttribe.com/ accessed April 21, 2016.">(Sault Tribe 2016)</a>.  The position of the Sault Tribe along the lakeshore of Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron give the Sault Tribe a unique opportunity for environmental impact, as well as an increased level of vulnerability with the threats of climate change.

		 </p>
		 <p>In December of 2014, the Sault Tribe was recognized by President Barack Obama as a Climate Action Champion at the White House Tribal Nations Conference <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Indian Country Media Network. 2014. Obama Names Two Tribes Among 16 Climate Champions Nationwide. http://www.inctm.com/ accessed April 21, 2016.">(Indian Country Media Network 2014)</a>.</p>
		 <br>
		 <h4> What is the Sault Tribe doing to earn this recognition?</h4>
		 <p>All buildings under the Tribe’s control have been built with environmentally friendly construction methods.  In recent years, all rental homes were updated and retrofitted for water, heating, and energy efficiency <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="St. Ignace News. 2014. Tribe Earns Award. http://stignacenews.com/ accessed April 21, 2016.">(St. Ignace News 2014)</a>.  All vehicles used for the fishery department have been converted to run on recycled cooking oil rather than diesel fuels <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="St. Ignace News. 2014. Tribe Earns Award. http://stignacenews.com/ accessed April 21, 2016.">(St. Ignace News 2014)</a>.  The tribe has a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 4% every year, and is researching the possibility of installing renewable energy sources such as windmills.  Along with all of these tribal programs, the Sault Tribe is also partnering with local 4-H units to plant more trees and shrubs, and is developing a food waste recycling program <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="St. Ignace News. 2014. Tribe Earns Award. http://stignacenews.com/ accessed April 21, 2016.">(St. Ignace News 2014)</a>.</p>
		 <p>Aside from energy efficiency, the Sault Tribe also plays a large role in the management of fish and wildlife in the Eastern Upper Peninsula and the Straits of Mackinac waterways.  The Sault Tribe has an Inland Fish and Wildlife Department.  This department works in conjunction with the United States Forest Service to report harvest statistics, recommend harvest levels, conduct fish and wildlife population and habitat research, and represent the Sault Tribe on committees <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Sault Tribe. 2016. Inland Fish and Wildlife Department. http://www.saulttribe.com/ accessed April 21, 2016.">(Sault Tribe 2016)</a>.</p>
		 <p>The Sault Tribe also has an Environmental Department whose mission is “to protect the health and wellbeing of present and future members of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, by protecting the environment on which they depend” <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Sault Tribe. 2016. Environmental Department. http://www.saulttribe.com/ accessed April 21, 2016.">(Sault Tribe 2016)</a>.  The Environmental Department has jurisdiction over the lands and waters in the 1836 Treaty Territory.  This includes 21,621 square miles of land, and 17,000 square miles in Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Sault Tribe. 2014. Inland Harvest Guide 2014. http://www.saulttribe.com/ accessed April 21, 2016.">(Sault Tribe 2014)</a>.  They enforce rulings determined in conjunction with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.</p>

 		  <p>There are many environmental threats currently facing the Sault Tribe.  Some of the main environmental concerns today include Line 5 Oil Pipeline, Chronic Wasting Disease, invasive zebra mussels, change in forest cover, and many more.  The Sault Tribe is an example of what one community is doing to combat these issues, and does not speak for all nations.</p>
